# Title : Applying TOPSIS to find best trained model for Text Summarization

## *1. Methodology*
<img src = "" width = "100%" height="100%" />

## *2. Description*
<img src = "" width = "100%" height="100%" />
Now we have to decide with the help of TOPSIS that which model has the best performance and this can be found out with the help of TOPSIS score.

## *3. Input*
The below is the text input on which we want to test five models.
<img src = "https://github.com/Chirag230/Text-Summarization/assets/108383033/9935b854-a1aa-4464-b42c-6ef971690cde" width = "100%" height="100%" />

## *4. Output*
<img src="" width="120%" height="120%">

## *5. Conclusion*
Hence we can conclude that Model-1 performed best in our case.
