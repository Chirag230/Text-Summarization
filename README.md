# Title : Applying TOPSIS to find best trained model for Text Summarization

## *1. Methodology*
<img src = "" width = "100%" height="100%" />

## *2. Description*
<img src = "" width = "100%" height="100%" />
Now we have to decide with the help of TOPSIS that which model has the best performance and this can be found out with the help of TOPSIS score.

## *3. Input*
The below is the text input on which we want to test five models.
<img src = "" width = "100%" height="100%" />
The below is the input which will be given to TOPSIS.
<img src="" width="100%" height="100%">

## *4. Output*
<img src="" width="120%" height="120%">

## *5. Conclusion*
Hence we can conclude that Model-1 performed best in our case.
